MAY 4, 2007
VERSION 1.2.0 RELEASED
----------------------

May 4, 2007
* [FOD] Bugs corrected in decoding of command line (getopt.c), in the handling of 16 bit files (t1.c and tcd.c) and the calculation of elapsed time for multiple tiles parts (tcd.c and tdc.h).

June 2, 2007
+ [GB] OPJViewer opens now BMP, PNG, GIF, PNM, TIFF (with wxWidgets internals); added an encoder settings tab, for future integration with "save file as..." in JPEG 2000 format

May 31, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed the handling of 16bit TIFF files for cinema compression. Modified "convert.c"
* [FOD] Fixed the parameters used for cinema compression (9-7 transform used instead of 5-3). Modified "image_to_j2k.c"

May 24, 2007
* [FOD] Bug fixed by Sylvain Munaut. Change in the reading of the POC marker. Since COD/COC can be anywhere in the header, the decoder cannot always know while decoding the POC marker the value of numlayers and numresolution.

May 23, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This makes the t1 data arrays dynamic, which greatly reduces cache thrashing. Also, some minor cleanup to prevent unnecessary casts"

May 22, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "Some formatting cleanups, so that the long function definitions and calls fit on screen. Use of prefix increment which is theoretically faster, in practice any sane compiler can optimize a postfix increment but its best not to count on such things. Consolidation of some redundant calculations in the inner loops, which becomes very useful in the future autovectorize patch."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This changes the flag code in t1 to use a flag_t type, which can then be changed to reduce RAM usage. It is now typedef to a short."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This patch makes the t1 LUTs static. I actually intend this as a prelude to possibly eliminating some or all of the LUTs entirely."

May 11, 2007
- [FOD]	JP3D library Binaries removed from SVN.
! [FOD] MJ2 codec updated from LibOpenJPEG version 0.97 to LibOpenJPEG version 1. Hence, the MJ2 codec will now take advantage of all the improvements and optimizations done on the LibOpenJPEG library.
! [FOD] Possibility to choose to apply MCT (multiple component transform) enabled, and new decoding_limit: DECODE_ALL_BUT_PACKETS (openjpeg.h)

April 26, 2007
+ [gdcm] Add basic steps on how to use CMake for building examples (README.cmake)

April 25, 2007
+ [FOD] Modification of the openjpeg.h file to avoid and ABI break with v1.1, removed the dangerous #IFDEF JPWL and added tcp_mct in cparameters.

March 28, 2007

March 27, 2007
+ [GB] Improved parsing in OPJViewer, as well some minor aesthetic modifications; support for image rendering with bit depths lower than 8 bits; can display an arbitrary frame of an MJ2 file (only in B/W, though); can reload a file; better resizing capabilities
* [GB] Following to Hervé's suggestions, all the exit() calls, added by JPWL strict checking in t2.c and j2k.c, have been substituted with (object free'ing + opj_evt_message(EVT_ERROR) + return)

----------------------
February 23, 2007
VERSION 1.1.1 RELEASED
----------------------

February 23, 2007
* [GB] Fixed a copy-and-paste type assignment error (bool instead of int) in the JPWL section of decoder parameters structure in openjpeg.h; minor type-casting in jpwl_lib.c. As a result, now OPJViewer should run correctly when built against the most current SVN trunk of LibOpenJPEG.lib
+ [GB] Linux makefile for the JPWL module; newlines at end of JPWL files

February 22, 2007
+ [FOD] Added the OPJViewer Module (/OPJViewer), developed by Giuseppe Baruffa of the university of Perugia

February 13, 2007
! [FOD] David Fries suggestions. In image_to_j2k and j2k_to_image, strncpy() functions: instead of specifying the path size macro, let the compiler read the length out of the array entry.
! [FOD] David Fries suggestions. Makefile modified. -fPIC flag used for 64-bit compilation. Move operation (rather than copy) for the dist library creation, and -p flag added.

January 31, 2007
! [FOD] Extra tokens at the end of #endif directive corrected in openjpeg.c, j2k.c and image_to_j2k.c -> no more warnings in linux compilation
! [FOD] Linux Makefile added for the codec

January 30, 2007
! [FOD] Use of OPJ_PATH_LEN (defined as 4096) to be the maximum allowed size for filenames instead of MAX_PATH which is not always defined. This caused some programs using OpenJPEG to crash. Modifications in openjpeg.h j2k_to_image.c and image_to_j2k.c
! [FOD] Correction of the syntax usage in MJ2_codec/mj2_to_frames.c

January 23, 2007
! [FOD] Modification in the context numbers, to reflect what has been specified in standard, in libopenjpeg/t1.h

December 07, 2006
+ [Giuseppe Baruffa] Antonin verified that the MacOS build suffered from a missing definition of the "min" macro; I've added this definition (properly #ifndef'ed) into both jpwl.h and rs.h

December 05, 2006
* [Giuseppe Baruffa] Better fix of the TPH EPBs bug in JPWL module
* [GB] Fixed the UEP bug in JPWL module; now, during a UEP specification, RS protection or CRC check can be switched off for selected range of packets, and consequently reswitched on without confusing the decoder
+ [GB] Added some lines in the help of JPWL_image_to_j2k, specifying that when using error protection on data packets, this must be paired with header protection, i.e. there cannot be packet protection without header protection

    ! [FOD] Modifications of libopenjpeg to integrate JPWL module (in libopenjpeg directory): j2k.c, j2k.h, openjpeg.c, openjpeg.h, opj_includes.g, t2.c
