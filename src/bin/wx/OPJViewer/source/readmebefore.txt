What is OpenJPEG ?
==================
The OpenJPEG library is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, the new still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). In addition to the basic codec, various other features are under development, among them the JP2 and MJ2 (Motion JPEG 2000) file formats, an indexing tool useful for the JPIP protocol, JPWL-tools for error-resilience, a Java-viewer for j2k-images, ... 

Who can use the library ?
=========================
Anybody. As the OpenJPEG library is released under the BSD license, anybody can use or modify the library, even for commercial applications. The only restriction is to retain the copyright in the sources or the binaries documentation.

Who is developing the library ?
===============================
The library is developed by the Communications and Remote Sensing Lab (TELE), in the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain (UCL). The JPWL module is developed and maintained by the Digital Signal Processing Lab (DSPLab) of the University of Perugia, Italy (UNIPG). As our purpose is to make OpenJPEG really useful for those interested in the image compression field, any feedback/advices are obviously welcome ! We will do our best to handle them quickly.
